# Xbox_features
IDO: I need help in understanding where do I put these in the code... how do they communicate with my MAIN psychopy code? maybe an example script where it is implemented? 
1. Xbox_vibration_control.py file includes the code used to set up a connection with the xbox controller motors and controlling each motor individually.

2. pygame_joystick_initilization.py file explains how to initialize the conncetion with the xbox joystick and how to use its' features (Mainly event types and values).

Further details are included in both files with helpful links.
