1. Xbox_vibration_control.py file includes the code used to set up a connection with the xbox controller motors and controlling each motor individually. For simplicity, this code can be added to the main psychopy file as is and can be used by calling the function defined in this file. Another way is importing this file from within the main psychopy file and using its' functions normally. 

2. pygame_joystick_initilization.py file explains how to initialize the conncetion with the xbox joystick and how to use its' features (mainly event types and values). Code lines in this file should be added directly to the same file used to write up the main psychopy experiment where the window and experiment itself are defined. 

* Further details are included in both files with helpful links. 
* An example of how these codes should be implemented can be found in file "example.py"
